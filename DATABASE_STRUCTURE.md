# Database Structure - User/Business Relationship

## Overview
The application now follows a proper SaaS structure with separate `users` and `businesses` tables, similar to real-world SaaS applications.

## Database Tables

### 1. Users Table
**Purpose**: Handle authentication and user management
```sql
users:
- id (primary key)
- name
- email (unique)
- password
- email_verified_at
- remember_token
- created_at
- updated_at
```

### 2. Businesses Table
**Purpose**: Store business-specific information
```sql
businesses:
- id (primary key)
- user_id (foreign key to users.id)
- business_name
- phone
- state
- city
- address
- cac_number
- cac_document_path
- registration_date
- business_type
- director_name
- director_email
- director_phone
- director_id_type
- director_id_number
- director_id_path
- registration_status
- is_primary (boolean)
- created_at
- updated_at
```

## Relationships

### User → Business (One-to-Many)
- One user can own multiple businesses
- Each business belongs to one user
- `is_primary` flag indicates the main business for a user

### Key Methods
```php
// User Model
$user->businesses() // Get all businesses owned by user
$user->primaryBusiness() // Get the primary business

// Business Model
$business->user() // Get the user who owns this business
```

## Registration Flow

1. **User Registration**: Creates a user account with email/password
2. **Business Creation**: Creates a business linked to the user
3. **CAC Information**: Updates business with CAC details
4. **Director Information**: Updates business with director details
5. **Email Verification**: Verifies user's email (optional)

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Scalability**: Users can register multiple businesses
2. **Security**: Authentication is separate from business data
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to add more user-related features
4. **Best Practices**: Follows SaaS application patterns
5. **Data Integrity**: Proper foreign key relationships
