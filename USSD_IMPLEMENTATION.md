# USSD Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This implementation provides a complete USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) management system for the Laravel application. Users can create, manage, and configure USSD services for their businesses.

## Features

### 1. USSD Management
- **Create USSD Services**: Users can create new USSD services with name, description, and pattern
- **Edit USSD Services**: Modify existing USSD service details
- **Delete USSD Services**: Remove USSD services from the system
- **Toggle Status**: Activate/deactivate USSD services
- **View Details**: Comprehensive view of USSD service information

### 2. Business Integration
- Each USSD service is associated with a specific business
- Users can only manage USSD services for their own businesses
- Proper authorization and access control

### 3. Dashboard Integration
- USSD statistics on the main dashboard
- Quick access to USSD management features
- Visual indicators for active/inactive services

## Database Structure

### USSD Table
```sql
ussds:
- id (primary key)
- name (string) - USSD service name
- description (text) - Service description
- pattern (string, unique) - USSD code pattern (e.g., "123#")
- user_id (foreign key) - Owner of the USSD service
- business_id (foreign key) - Associated business
- is_active (boolean) - Service status
- created_at, updated_at (timestamps)
```

### Relationships
- **User → USSD**: One-to-Many (User can have multiple USSD services)
- **Business → USSD**: One-to-Many (Business can have multiple USSD services)
- **USSD → User**: Many-to-One (Each USSD belongs to one user)
- **USSD → Business**: Many-to-One (Each USSD belongs to one business)

## Usage Examples

### Creating a USSD Service
1. Navigate to Dashboard → "Create New USSD"
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: "Bank Balance Check"
   - **Description**: "Check account balance via USSD"
   - **Pattern**: "123#"
   - **Business**: Select your business
3. Click "Create USSD Service"

### Managing USSD Services
1. View all services at `/ussd`
2. Click "View" to see details
3. Use "Edit" to modify service
4. Toggle status to activate/deactivate
5. Use "Delete" to remove service

### Dashboard Integration
- Dashboard shows USSD statistics
- Quick access to create new USSD
- Links to manage existing services

## Testing

### Sample Data
Run the USSD seeder to create sample data:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=USSDSeeder
```

### Factory
Use the USSDFactory for testing:
```php
// Create a USSD service
$ussd = USSD::factory()->create();

// Create an active USSD service
$ussd = USSD::factory()->active()->create();

// Create an inactive USSD service
$ussd = USSD::factory()->inactive()->create();
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **USSD Flow Configuration**: Visual flow builder for USSD menus
2. **Response Templates**: Pre-built response templates
3. **Analytics**: Usage statistics and reporting
4. **API Integration**: Connect to actual USSD gateway
5. **Testing Simulator**: Interactive USSD testing tool
6. **Bulk Operations**: Manage multiple USSD services at once

### Technical Improvements
1. **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed USSD data
2. **Queue Jobs**: Background processing for USSD operations
3. **Webhooks**: Real-time notifications for USSD events
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of USSD services

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Pattern Already Exists**: Ensure USSD patterns are unique
2. **Business Not Found**: Verify business exists and belongs to user
3. **Permission Denied**: Check user authentication and ownership

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check USSD table structure
php artisan migrate:status

# Clear cache if needed
php artisan cache:clear

# Regenerate autoload files
composer dump-autoload
```
